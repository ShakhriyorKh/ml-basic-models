# Basic ML models

Here I have three models.
1. Model is for binary classification and about the reviews from IMDB. So my model try to predict a review label (positive/negative) based on the training data from Keras.
2. This model is build using scalar regularization and I am using here dataset consisting of houses data from Boston with numerical 13 features each house. Based on the given data my model predicts prices of house.
3. In the last model I have used multiclassification. The model is learned to predict topic of the article out of 46 topics (features) based on the given text.
