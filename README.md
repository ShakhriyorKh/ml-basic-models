# Basic ML models

Here I have three models.
1. A model is for binary classification and about reviews from IMDB. So my model tries to predict a review label (positive/negative) based on the training data from Keras.
2. This model is build using a scalar regularization and I am using here a dataset consisting of houses data from Boston with numerical 13 features each house. Based on the given data my model predicts price of a house.
3. In the last model I have used a multiclassification. The model is learned to predict a topic of the article out of 46 topics (features) based on the given text.
